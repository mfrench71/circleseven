More learning and experimenting with my new favourite piece of software, Blender. Following Oliver Villar's [Blendtuts.com tutorial](http://blendtuts.com/tutorials-list/2015/2/15/how-to-create-a-3d-logo), I picked up some useful skills, particularly creating shapes using the bezier curve and handle types.

The logo outline was created in Adobe Illustrator, set as a back ground image in Blender and then traced using bezier curves. You can draw squares by first drawing a circle and then changing the handle type to Vector - squaring the circle!

Once the outline was created, it is then extruded and bevelled to create the final solid-looking logo. There was an issue with the 'm' where I extruded two bezier segments at the same time, causing the bevel to behave strangely.
