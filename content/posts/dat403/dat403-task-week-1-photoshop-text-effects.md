Today's practical exercise focussed on text effects within Photoshop.

I created the following from a high contrast photo:

{{< post-image image="dat403-photoshop-text-featured.jpg" class="" width="300" caption="Text effects finished image" >}}

Briefly, the steps taken to create this effect are:

- Select > Colour Range > Shadows
- New Layer > Fill Black
- Select Colour Range > Midtones
- New Layer > Fill Black
- Create two text layers and fill with text
- With the text layer selected, load a selection from the Shadows layer
- Add a layer mask
- Repeat for the other text layer using the Midtones layer
- Adjust the typeface and settings to achieve the desired look

We also looked at the six _elements_ of design:

1. Line
2. Shape/form
3. Space
4. Texture
5. Value
6. Colour

And the _principles_ of design:

1. Balance
2. Alignment
3. Proximity/unity
4. Repetition/consistency
5. Contrast
6. White space

We briefly looked at the Gestalt psychology principles of perception:

1. Figure/ground (contrast/dominance)
2. Similarity (repetition)
3. Proximity (balance/contrast)
4. Closure
5. Continuation
